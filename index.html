<h2>Apple's</h2>
<p>"An apple a day keeps the doctor away" was one of my
  elementary teacher's favorite quote.  My teacher said the
  quote so many times that he practically drilled it to my head,
  but hey, I like apples and eating them is a healthy thing, so
  he did me a favor.

<h2>The Pirate Bay</h2>
<p>One of my favorite sites online is The Pirate Bay (TPB).
  TBP is an index of digital content, and it allows me to
  download things that otherwise I wound not have access to -
  books, programs, videos, ect.  I acknowledge that most of the
   things distributed on TPB brake cpyright infringement, but if
    you're broke and in need, then this is the perfect site.
